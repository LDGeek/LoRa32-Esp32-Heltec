Persion practice for code and english.
stage 1
		learning fast
		to know what is the core
		to know how to use
		find a way to learn as natural language or mother language
		the basic hardest part is the punctuation,it is complexity
         as the english grammatically collcation or the syntax rules.
the short way is learn and know all the punctuation's.

		but there is no knowledge line to show that way about learn a
	code language from that.

		I was thinking of what kind of basic source code can show
	all the syntax and punctuation in one single code file.and show 
	all.
